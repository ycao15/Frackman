# FrackMan
UCLA CS32 2D Game Project

The player controls an oil fracker searching for barrels of oil in a 2D dirt field while evading protesters. Along the way, he can collect goodies such as: <br>
<ul>
  <li>gold - bribe protesters</li>
  <li>sonar kits - uncover the locations of other goodies nearby</li>
  <li>water pools - reload the squirt gun to annoy protesters</li>
</ul>  
Bribing protesters, collecting goodies, and finding the barrels of oil increases the player's score.
Levels are procedurally generated and become increasingly difficult.
